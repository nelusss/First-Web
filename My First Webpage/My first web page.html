    <pr>Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend; so, the full-stack of technology that makes up a website.They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments.To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.Essentially, full-stack developers are T-shaped developers. But what does that mean?The T-shaped model is a concept that has been around for a while that describes the abilities or characteristics of an individual. An ideal T-shaped person has many generalized skills, with a specialization in one or a few specific fields.A full-stack web developer is an excellent example of this model, as the developer has general knowledge across a wide breadth of technologies and platforms as well as in-depth experience and specialization in a couple of those concepts. Rather than having to develop complex proprietary code every time for creating different websites, frameworks have become popular resources to make many processes more efficient and convenient.</pr>
